# Learning Log - M1A3 GitHub Repository Management

**Student:** Jake Fell  
**Date:** 10-23-2025

## What I Learned
In this assignment, I learned:
- How to create new files and folders.
- How to link two separate repositories.
- How to create a new repository.

## Challenges and Solutions
I found it difficult to keep things clear when working between two different repositories, but I learned that having clear naming conventions and documenting changes goes a long way.

## Connection to My GIS Career
I've worked on software development in my career previously and GitHub is extremely helpful for working with others. I'm hoping to continue improving these skills.

## Open Source Workflow Understanding
Creating my own repository (`hello-gist604b`) mirrors the open source contribution process. In real projects, developers fork existing repositories, make improvements, and submit contributions - similar to how I created this repository and linked it to the assignment system.
